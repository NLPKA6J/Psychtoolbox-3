% PsychOculusVR1 - A high level driver for Oculus VR hardware using the Version 1.11+ runtime.
%
% Note: If you want to write VR code that is portable across
% VR headsets of different vendors, then use the PsychVRHMD()
% driver instead of this driver. The PsychVRHMD driver will use
% this driver as appropriate when connecting to a Oculus Rift
% or similar Oculus device, but it will also automatically work
% with other head mounted displays. This driver does however
% expose a few functions specific to Oculus hardware, so you can
% mix calls to this driver with calls to PsychVRHMD to do some
% mix & match.
%
% For setup instructions for Oculus HMDs see "help OculusVR".
%
%
% Usage:
%
% hmd = PsychOculusVR1('AutoSetupHMD' [, basicTask='Tracked3DVR'][, basicRequirements][, basicQuality=0][, deviceIndex]);
% - Open a Oculus HMD, set it up with good default rendering and
% display parameters and generate a PsychImaging('AddTask', ...)
% line to setup the Psychtoolbox imaging pipeline for proper display
% on the HMD. This will also cause the device connection to get
% auto-closed as soon as the onscreen window which displays on
% the HMD is closed. Returns the 'hmd' handle of the HMD on success.
%
% By default, the first detected HMD will be used and if no VR HMD
% is connected, it will return an empty [] hmd handle. You can override
% this default choice of HMD by specifying the optional 'deviceIndex'
% parameter to choose a specific HMD. However, only one HMD per machine is
% supported, so the 'deviceIndex' will probably be only useful in the future.
%
% More optional parameters: 'basicTask' what kind of task should be implemented.
% The default is 'Tracked3DVR', which means to setup for stereoscopic 3D
% rendering, driven by head motion tracking, for a fully immersive experience
% in some kind of 3D virtual world. This is the default if omitted. The task
% 'Stereoscopic' sets up for display of stereoscopic stimuli, but without
% head tracking. 'Monoscopic' sets up for display of monocular stimuli, ie.
% the HMD is just used as a special kind of standard display monitor. In 'Monoscopic'
% and 'Stereoscopic' mode, both eyes will be presented with an identical field of view,
% to make sure pure 2D drawing works, without the need for setup of special per-eye
% projection transformations. In 'Tracked3DVR' mode, each eye will have a different
% field of view, optimized to maximize the viewable area while still avoiding occlusion
% artifacts due to the nose of the wearer of the HMD.
%
% 'basicRequirements' defines basic requirements for the task. Currently
% defined are the following strings which can be combined into a single
% 'basicRequirements' string:
%
% 'DebugDisplay' = Show the output which is displayed on the HMD inside the
% Psychtoolbox onscreen window as well. This will have a negative impact on
% performance, latency and timing of the HMD visual presentation, so should only
% be used for debugging, as it may cause a seriously degraded VR experience.
% By default, no such debug output is produced and the Psychtoolbox onscreen
% window is not actually displayed on the desktop.
%
% 'Float16Display' = Request rendering, compositing and display in 16 bpc float
% format. This will ask Psychtoolbox to render and post-process stimuli in 16 bpc
% linear floating point format, and allocate 16 bpc half-float textures as final
% renderbuffers to be sent to the VR compositor. If the VR compositor takes advantage
% of the high source image precision is at the discretion of the compositor and HMD.
% By default, if this request is omitted, processing and display in sRGB format is
% requested from Psychtoolbox and the compositor, ie., a roughly gamma 2.2 8 bpc
% format is used, which is optimized for the gamma response curve of at least the Oculus
% Rift CV1 display.
%
% 'PerEyeFOV' = Request use of per eye individual and asymmetric fields of view even
% when the 'basicTask' was selected to be 'Monoscopic' or 'Stereoscopic'. This allows
% for wider field of view in these tasks, but requires the usercode to adapt to these
% different and asymmetric fields of view for each eye, e.g., by selecting proper 3D
% projection matrices for each eye.
%
% 'TimingSupport' = Support some hardware specific means of timestamping
% or latency measurements. On the Rift DK1 this does nothing. On the DK2
% it enables dynamic prediction and timing measurements with the Rifts internal
% latency tester.
%
% 'basicQuality' defines the basic tradeoff between quality and required
% computational power. A setting of 0 gives lowest quality, but with the
% lowest performance requirements. A setting of 1 gives maximum quality at
% maximum computational load. Values between 0 and 1 change the quality to
% performance tradeoff.
%
%
% hmd = PsychOculusVR1('Open' [, deviceIndex], ...);
% - Open HMD with index 'deviceIndex'. See PsychOculusVRCore1 Open?
% for help on additional parameters.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR1('SetAutoClose', hmd, mode);
% - Set autoclose mode for HMD with handle 'hmd'. 'mode' can be
% 0 (this is the default) to not do anything special. 1 will close
% the HMD 'hmd' when the onscreen window is closed which displays
% on the HMD. 2 will do the same as 1, but close all open HMDs and
% shutdown the complete driver and Oculus runtime - a full cleanup.
%
%
% isOpen = PsychOculusVR1('IsOpen', hmd);
% - Returns 1 if 'hmd' corresponds to an open HMD, 0 otherwise.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR1('Close' [, hmd])
% - Close provided HMD device 'hmd'. If no 'hmd' handle is provided,
% all HMDs will be closed and the driver will be shutdown.
%
%
% info = PsychOculusVR1('GetInfo', hmd);
% - Retrieve a struct 'info' with information about the HMD 'hmd'.
% The returned info struct contains at least the following standardized
% fields with information:
%
% handle = Driver internal handle for the specific HMD.
% driver = Function handle to the actual driver for the HMD, e.g., @PsychOculusVR1.
% type   = Defines the type/vendor of the device, e.g., 'Oculus'.
% modelName = Name string with the name of the model of the device, e.g., 'Rift DK2'.
% separateEyePosesSupported = 1 if use of PsychOculusVR1('GetEyePose') will improve
%                             the quality of the VR experience, 0 if no improvement
%                             is to be expected, so 'GetEyePose' can be avoided
%                             to save processing time without a loss of quality.
%                             This always returns 1 for at least the Rift DK1 and DK2,
%                             as use of that function can enhance the quality of the
%                             VR experience with fast head movements.
%
% The returned struct may contain more information, but the fields mentioned
% above are the only ones guaranteed to be available over the long run. Other
% fields may disappear or change their format and meaning anytime without
% warning.
%
%
% isSupported = PsychOculusVR1('Supported');
% - Returns 1 if the Oculus driver is functional, 0 otherwise. The
% driver is functional if the VR runtime library was successfully
% initialized and a connection to the VR server process has been
% established. It would return 0 if the server process would not be
% running, or if the required runtime library would not be correctly
% installed.
%
%
% state = PsychOculusVR1('PrepareRender', hmd [, userTransformMatrix][, reqmask=1][, targetTime]);
% - Mark the start of the rendering cycle for a new 3D rendered stereoframe.
% Return a struct 'state' which contains various useful bits of information
% for 3D stereoscopic rendering of a scene, based on head tracking data.
%
% 'hmd' is the handle of the HMD which delivers tracking data and receives the
% rendered content for display.
%
% 'reqmask' defines what kind of information is requested to be returned in
% struct 'state'. Only query information you actually need, as computing some
% of this info is expensive! See below for supported values for 'reqmask'.
%
% 'targetTime' is the expected time at which the rendered frame will display.
% This could potentially be used by the driver to make better predictions of
% camera/eye/head pose for the image. Omitting the value will use a target time
% that is implementation specific, but known to give generally good results,
% e.g., the midpoint of scanout of the next video frame.
%
% 'userTransformMatrix' is an optional 4x4 right hand side (RHS) transformation
% matrix. It gets applied to the tracked head pose as a global transformation
% before computing results based on head pose like, e.g., camera transformations.
% You can use this to translate the "virtual head" and thereby the virtual eyes/
% cameras in the 3D scene, so observer motion is not restricted to the real world
% tracking volume of your headset. A typical 'userTransformMatrix' would be a
% combined translation and rotation matrix to position the observer at some
% 3D location in space, then define his/her global looking direction, aka as
% heading angle, yaw orientation, or rotation around the y-axis in 3D space.
% Head pose tracking results would then operate relative to this global transform.
% If 'userTransformMatrix' is left out, it will default to an identity transform,
% in other words, it will do nothing.
%
%
% state always contains a field state.tracked, whose bits signal the status
% of head tracking for this frame. A +1 flag means that head orientation is
% tracked. A +2 flag means that head position is tracked via some absolute
% position tracker like, e.g., the Oculus Rift DK2 camera.
%
% 'reqmask' defaults to 1 and can have the following values added together:
%
% +1 = Return matrices for left and right "eye cameras" which can be directly
%      used as OpenGL GL_MODELVIEW matrices for rendering the scene. 4x4 matrices
%      for left- and right eye are contained in state.modelView{1} and {2}.
%
%      Return position and orientation 4x4 camera view matrices which describe
%      position and orientation of the "eye cameras" relative to the world
%      reference frame. They are the inverses of state.modelView{}. These
%      matrices can be directly used to define cameras for rendering of complex
%      3D scenes with the Horde3D 3D engine. Left- and right eye matrices are
%      contained in state.cameraView{1} and {2}.
%
%      Additionally tracked/predicted head pose is returned in state.localHeadPoseMatrix
%      and the global head pose after application of the 'userTransformMatrix' is
%      returned in state.globalHeadPoseMatrix - this is the basis for computing
%      the camera transformation matrices.
%
% More flags to follow...
%
%
% eyePose = PsychOculusVR1('GetEyePose', hmd, renderPass [, userTransformMatrix][, targetTime]);
% - Return a struct 'eyePose' which contains various useful bits of information
% for 3D stereoscopic rendering of the stereo view of one eye, based on head
% tracking data. This function provides essentially the same information as
% the 'PrepareRender' function, but only for one eye. Therefore you will need
% to call this function twice, once for each of the two renderpasses, at the
% beginning of each renderpass.
%
% 'hmd' is the handle of the HMD which delivers tracking data and receives the
% rendered content for display.
%
% 'renderPass' defines if information should be returned for the 1st renderpass
% (renderPass == 0) or for the 2nd renderpass (renderPass == 1). The driver will
% decide for you if the 1st renderpass should render the left eye and the 2nd
% pass the right eye, or if the 1st renderpass should render the right eye and
% then the 2nd renderpass the left eye. The ordering depends on the properties
% of the video display of your HMD, specifically on the video scanout order:
% Is it right to left, left to right, or top to bottom? For each scanout order
% there is an optimal order for the renderpasses to minimize perceived lag.
%
% 'targetTime' is the expected time at which the rendered frame will display.
% This could potentially be used by the driver to make better predictions of
% camera/eye/head pose for the image. Omitting the value will use a target time
% that is implementation specific, but known to give generally good results.
%
% 'userTransformMatrix' is an optional 4x4 right hand side (RHS) transformation
% matrix. It gets applied to the tracked head pose as a global transformation
% before computing results based on head pose like, e.g., camera transformations.
% You can use this to translate the "virtual head" and thereby the virtual eyes/
% cameras in the 3D scene, so observer motion is not restricted to the real world
% tracking volume of your headset. A typical 'userTransformMatrix' would be a
% combined translation and rotation matrix to position the observer at some
% 3D location in space, then define his/her global looking direction, aka as
% heading angle, yaw orientation, or rotation around the y-axis in 3D space.
% Head pose tracking results would then operate relative to this global transform.
% If 'userTransformMatrix' is left out, it will default to an identity transform,
% in other words, it will do nothing.
%
% Return values in struct 'eyePose':
%
% 'eyeIndex' The eye for which this information applies. 0 = Left eye, 1 = Right eye.
%            You can pass 'eyeIndex' into the Screen('SelectStereoDrawBuffer', win, eyeIndex)
%            to select the proper eye target render buffer.
%
% 'modelView' is a 4x4 RHS OpenGL matrix which can be directly used as OpenGL
%             GL_MODELVIEW matrix for rendering the scene.
%
% 'cameraView' contains a 4x4 RHS camera matrix which describes position and
%              orientation of the "eye camera" relative to the world reference
%              frame. It is the inverse of eyePose.modelView. This matrix can
%              be directly used to define the camera for rendering of complex
%              3D scenes with the Horde3D 3D engine or other engines which want
%              absolute camera pose instead of the inverse matrix.
%
% Additionally tracked/predicted head pose is returned in eyePose.localHeadPoseMatrix
% and the global head pose after application of the 'userTransformMatrix' is
% returned in eyePose.globalHeadPoseMatrix - this is the basis for computing
% the camera transformation matrix.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR1('SetupRenderingParameters', hmd [, basicTask='Tracked3DVR'][, basicRequirements][, basicQuality=0][, fov=[HMDRecommended]][, pixelsPerDisplay=1])
% - Query the HMD 'hmd' for its properties and setup internal rendering
% parameters in preparation for opening an onscreen window with PsychImaging
% to display properly on the HMD. See section about 'AutoSetupHMD' above for
% the meaning of the optional parameters 'basicTask', 'basicRequirements'
% and 'basicQuality'.
%
% 'fov' Optional field of view in degrees, from line of sight: [leftdeg, rightdeg,
% updeg, downdeg]. If 'fov' is omitted, the HMD runtime will be asked for a
% good default field of view and that will be used. The field of view may be
% dependent on the settings in the HMD user profile of the currently selected
% user.
%
% 'pixelsPerDisplay' Ratio of the number of render target pixels to display pixels
% at the center of distortion. Defaults to 1.0 if omitted. Lower values can
% improve performance, at lower quality.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR1('SetBasicQuality', hmd, basicQuality);
% - Set basic level of quality vs. required GPU performance.
%
%
% oldSetting = PsychOculusVR1('SetFastResponse', hmd [, enable]);
% - Return old setting for 'FastResponse' mode in 'oldSetting',
% optionally disable or enable the mode via specifying the 'enable'
% parameter as 0 or greater than zero.
%
% Deprecated: This function does nothing. It just exists for (backwards)
% compatibility with the old Oculus driver and PsychVRHMD.
%
%
% oldSetting = PsychOculusVR1('SetTimeWarp', hmd [, enable]);
% - Return old setting for 'TimeWarp' mode in 'oldSetting',
% optionally enable or disable the mode via specifying the 'enable'
% parameter as 1 or 0.
%
% Deprecated: This function does nothing. It just exists for (backwards)
% compatibility with the old Oculus driver and PsychVRHMD.
%
%
% oldSetting = PsychOculusVR1('SetLowPersistence', hmd [, enable]);
% - Return old setting for 'LowPersistence' mode in 'oldSetting',
% optionally enable or disable the mode via specifying the 'enable'
% parameter as 1 or 0.
%
% Deprecated: This function does nothing. It just exists for (backwards)
% compatibility with the old Oculus driver and PsychVRHMD.
%
%
% oldSettings = PsychOculusVR1('PanelOverdriveParameters', hmd [, newparams]);
% - Return old settings for panel overdrive mode in 'oldSettings',
% optionally set new settings in 'newparams'. This changes the operating
% parameters of OLED panel overdrive on the Rift DK-2 if 'FastResponse'
% mode is active. newparams is a vector [upscale, downscale, gamma] with
% the following meaning: gamma = 1 Use gamma/degamma pass to perform
% overdrive boost in gamma 2.2 corrected space. This is the startup default.
% upscale = How much should rising pixel color intensity values be boosted.
% Default is 0.10 for a 10% boost.
% downscale = How much should rising pixel color intensity values be reduced.
% Default is 0.05 for a 5% reduction.
% The Rift DK-2 OLED panel controller is slower on rising intensities than on
% falling intensities, therefore the higher boost on rising than on falling
% direction.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR1('SetHSWDisplayDismiss', hmd [, dismissTypes=1+2+4]);
% - Set how the user can dismiss the "Health and safety warning display".
% Deprecated: This function does nothing. It just exists for (backwards)
% compatibility with the old Oculus driver and PsychVRHMD. The current OculusVR
% runtime 1.0 enforces display of the Health and Safety Warning at the beginning
% of each VR session.
%
%
% PsychOculusVR1('SetHUDState', hmd, mode);
% - Set mode of operation for the builtin head up display (HUD) for performance
% information. The HUD is automatically displayed and updated by the VR compositor
% if enabled, and can be in one of the following selectable 'mode's:
%
% 0 = Head up display HUD off ie. invisible.
% 1 = HUD shows performance summary.
% 2 = HUD shows latency timing.
% 3 = HUD shows application render timing.
% 4 = HUD shows VR compositor render timing.
% 5 = HUD shows Version information of different components.
% 6 = HUD shows Asynchronous time warp (ASW) stats.
% Higher numbers may do something useful in the future.
%
%
% [bufferSize, imagingFlags, stereoMode] = PsychOculusVR1('GetClientRenderingParameters', hmd);
% - Retrieve recommended size in pixels 'bufferSize' = [width, height] of the client
% renderbuffer for each eye for rendering to the HMD. Returns parameters
% previously computed by PsychOculusVR1('SetupRenderingParameters', hmd).
%
% Also returns 'imagingFlags', the required imaging mode flags for setup of
% the Screen imaging pipeline. Also returns the needed 'stereoMode' for the
% pipeline.
%
%
% needPanelFitter = PsychOculusVR1('GetPanelFitterParameters', hmd);
% - 'needPanelFitter' is 1 if a custom panel fitter tasks is needed, and 'bufferSize'
% from the PsychVRHMD('GetClientRenderingParameters', hmd); defines the size of the
% clientRect for the onscreen window. 'needPanelFitter' is 0 if no panel fitter is
% needed.
%
%
% [winRect, ovrfbOverrideRect, ovrSpecialFlags] = PsychOculusVR1('OpenWindowSetup', hmd, screenid, winRect, ovrfbOverrideRect, ovrSpecialFlags);
% - Compute special override parameters for given input/output arguments, as needed
% for a specific HMD. Take other preparatory steps as needed, immediately before the
% Screen('OpenWindow') command executes. This is called as part of PsychImaging('OpenWindow'),
% with the user provided hmd, screenid, winRect etc.
%
%
% isOutput = PsychOculusVR1('IsHMDOutput', hmd, scanout);
% - Returns 1 (true) if 'scanout' describes the video output to which the
% HMD 'hmd' is connected. 'scanout' is a struct returned by the Screen
% function Screen('ConfigureDisplay', 'Scanout', screenid, outputid);
% This allows probing video outputs to find the one which feeds the HMD.
% Deprecated: This function does nothing. It just exists for (backwards)
% compatibility with the old Oculus driver and PsychVRHMD.
%
%
% [headToEyeShiftv, headToEyeShiftMatrix] = PsychOculusVR1('GetEyeShiftVector', hmd, eye);
% - Retrieve 3D translation vector [tx, ty, tz] that defines the 3D position of the given
% eye 'eye' for the given HMD 'hmd', relative to the origin of the local head/HMD
% reference frame. This is needed to translate a global head pose into a eye
% pose, e.g., to translate the output of PsychOculusVR1('GetEyePose') into actual
% tracked/predicted eye locations for stereo rendering.
%
% In addition to the 'headToEyeShiftv' vector, a corresponding 4x4 translation
% matrix is also returned in 'headToEyeShiftMatrix' for convenience.

  % inject proper Present timestamps for 'Flip':
  % TODO FIXME: Nope, change of strategy: We set the kPsychSkipWaitForFlipOnce flag in
  % 'EndFrameRender', so PreSwapbuffersOperations does not wait until tWhen, but executes
  % immediately. We pass in the tWhen timestamp to this fast-path callback, which will pass
  % it on to 'PresentFrame', and then it is the job of the PsychOculusVRCore1 drivers thread
  % to wait until the right moment to submit the new frame to the VR compositor. This allows

  % right point in time. We retain the ability to 'Flip' as fast as possible for closed-loop

  % target times, and avoid all the multi-threading misery the Oculus runtime brings to us.
